Animation needs - 

A hero - This doesn't have to be an original model. It can be any model as long it has a free for use license.

The model needs to have a weapon model to accompany it. The weapon can be anything a sword , axe , spear etc.

The model needs to have the following animations.

Idel (standing around)
Attack (A simple weapon slash)
Run
Die
Jump

The animations should all be seperate actions instead of being on one time line.

Poly count medium 1000 - 3000

The model must be triangulated.

Format - Blender

This should be it for now let me know if there are anythings I missed.
